## 🚨 Slide 1: The Problem
**The "Blind Spot" in Global Supply Chains**

*   **The Complexity Trap**: Companies manage thousands of suppliers. Manually monitoring every local news source for every factory is impossible.
*   **The Invisible Risk**: Unnoticed violations (e.g., Forced Labor, Environmental Dumping) create ticking time bombs.
*   **The Consequence**:
    *   **Legal**: Massive fines under the EU Supply Chain Act.
    *   **Reputation**: Irreversible brand damage.
*   **The Gap**: Traditional tools check *financial* health but miss *ethical* risks buried in unstructured, multilingual data.

## 💡 Slide 2: The Solution - Sentinel
**"An AI Auditor that always alert"**

Sentinel is an autonomous **Multi-Agent System** that revolutionizes ethical due diligence.
1.  **Continuous Surveillance**: Scans global sources for supplier activities 24/7.
2.  **Contextual Intelligence**: Doesn't just match keywords—it *reasons* about severity using AWS Bedrock.
3.  **Policy Alignment**: Memorizes your specific "Code of Conduct" to judge violations against *your* standards.

## ⚙️ Slide 3: How It Works (Architecture)
**Powered by AWS Bedrock Agents**

*   **🧠 The Supervisor (Orchestrator)**: The brain that manages the workflow and delegates tasks.
*   **🕵️ The Investigator Agent**:
    *   *Role*: The "Detective".
    *   *Task*: Hunts for raw intelligence, scraping news and NGO reports for potential red flags.
*   **⚖️ The Auditor Agent**:
    *   *Role*: The "Judge".
    *   *Task*: Uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to cross-reference findings against the uploaded Corporate Policy PDF.

## 📊 Slide 4: Key Features
*   **🚦 Instant Risk Scoring**: Automated Red/Yellow/Green traffic light assessment.
*   **🔍 Traceable Evidence**: Every flag is cited with a specific source (e.g., "Reuters, Jan 2024") for full transparency.
*   **📄 Dynamic Policy Adaptation**: Fully customizable—upload a new Code of Conduct, and the AI adapts its judgment criteria instantly.

## 💰 Slide 5: Impact & Business Value

### 🚀 Business Innovation
*   **Workflow Transformation**: Automates manual compliance checks with intelligent AI agents.
*   **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces audit research time from **days to seconds**.
*   **Risk Mitigation**: Proactively identifies threats before they become headlines or lawsuits.
*   **Cost Avoidance**: Prevents millions in fines (EU Supply Chain Act penalties start at €250K).

### 🌍 Social Impact
*   **Human Rights Protection**: Actively fights forced labor and modern slavery in supply chains.
*   **Environmental Advocacy**: Detects and flags environmental violations before irreversible damage.
*   **Transparency at Scale**: Removes the veil of obscurity from global supply networks.

## 🔄 Slide 6: Reusability & Scalability
**Built for Universal Adoption**

*   **Industry Agnostic**: Works for any sector with supply chains (Fashion, Electronics, Food, Automotive).
*   **Modular Architecture**: Plug-and-play agents can be repurposed for other compliance domains (GDPR, Financial Audits).
*   **Multi-Language Support**: AWS Bedrock handles global news sources in any language.
*   **Open Integration**: REST APIs allow seamless connection to existing ERP/Supply Chain Management systems.

## 🔮 Slide 7: Technical Innovation & Future Roadmap

### 🎯 What Makes This Novel?
*   **Agentic AI at Scale**: True multi-agent collaboration (not just chained prompts).
*   **Context-Aware Reasoning**: RAG-powered policy interpretation, not rigid rule matching.
*   **Hybrid Intelligence**: Combines structured data (supplier databases) with unstructured intelligence (news, reports).

### 📍 Roadmap
*   **Phase 1 (Current)**: MVP with Multi-Agent Orchestration & Policy RAG.
*   **Phase 2**: Real-time Global Web Search integration (Serper API).
*   **Phase 3**: Blockchain verification for immutable audit logs.
