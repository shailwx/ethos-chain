# 🌍 EthosChain: The AI Supply Chain Ethics Watchdog
*Oslo GenAI Hackathon 2025*

---

## 🚨 Slide 1: The Problem
**The "Blind Spot" in Global Supply Chains**

*   **The Complexity Trap**: Companies manage thousands of suppliers. Manually monitoring every local news source for every factory is impossible.
*   **The Invisible Risk**: Unnoticed violations (e.g., Forced Labor, Environmental Dumping) create ticking time bombs.
*   **The Consequence**:
    *   **Legal**: Massive fines under the EU Supply Chain Act.
    *   **Reputation**: Irreversible brand damage.
*   **The Gap**: Traditional tools check *financial* health but miss *ethical* risks buried in unstructured, multilingual data.

## 💡 Slide 2: The Solution - EthosChain
**"An AI Auditor that never sleeps."**

EthosChain is an autonomous **Multi-Agent System** that revolutionizes ethical due diligence.
1.  **Continuous Surveillance**: Scans global sources for supplier activities 24/7.
2.  **Contextual Intelligence**: Doesn't just match keywords—it *reasons* about severity using AWS Bedrock.
3.  **Policy Alignment**: Memorizes your specific "Code of Conduct" to judge violations against *your* standards.

## ⚙️ Slide 3: How It Works (Architecture)
**Powered by AWS Bedrock Agents**

*   **🧠 The Supervisor (Orchestrator)**: The brain that manages the workflow and delegates tasks.
*   **🕵️ The Investigator Agent**:
    *   *Role*: The "Detective".
    *   *Task*: Hunts for raw intelligence, scraping news and NGO reports for potential red flags.
*   **⚖️ The Auditor Agent**:
    *   *Role*: The "Judge".
    *   *Task*: Uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to cross-reference findings against the uploaded Corporate Policy PDF.

## 📊 Slide 4: Key Features
*   **🚦 Instant Risk Scoring**: Automated Red/Yellow/Green traffic light assessment.
*   **🔍 Traceable Evidence**: Every flag is cited with a specific source (e.g., "Reuters, Jan 2024") for full transparency.
*   **📄 Dynamic Policy Adaptation**: Fully customizable—upload a new Code of Conduct, and the AI adapts its judgment criteria instantly.

---

## 💰 Slide 5: Impact & Business Value
*   **🚀 Operational Efficiency**: Reduces audit research time from **days to seconds**.
*   **🛡️ Risk Mitigation**: Proactively identifies threats before they become headlines or lawsuits.
*   **🌍 Social Responsibility**: Actively fights forced labor and environmental damage by removing the veil of obscurity from supply chains.

---

## 🔮 Slide 6: Future Roadmap
*   **Phase 1 (Current)**: MVP with Multi-Agent Orchestration & Policy RAG.
*   **Phase 2**: Real-time Global Web Search integration (Serper API).
*   **Phase 3**: Blockchain verification for immutable audit logs.
